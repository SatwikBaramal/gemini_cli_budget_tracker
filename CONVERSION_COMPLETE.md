### 3. Database Models
Created 4 Mongoose models:
- ✅ `src/lib/models/Expense.ts`
- ✅ `src/lib/models/Setting.ts`
- ✅ `src/lib/models/FixedExpense.ts`
- ✅ `src/lib/models/FixedExpenseOverride.ts`

### 4. API Routes Updated (12 files)
- ✅ `/api/income/route.ts`
- ✅ `/api/income/monthly/route.ts`
- ✅ `/api/expenses/route.ts`
- ✅ `/api/expenses/[id]/route.ts`
- ✅ `/api/expenses/monthly/route.ts`
- ✅ `/api/expenses/monthly/[month]/route.ts`

- ✅ `/api/fixed-expenses/overrides/[id]/route.ts`

### 5. Data Migration
- ✅ Created migration script: `scripts/migrate-to-mongodb.ts`
- ✅ Ran migration successfully
- ✅ Verified all data in MongoDB

### 6. Cleanup
- ✅ Deleted `src/lib/db.ts` (old SQLite file)
- ✅ Deleted `budget.db` (after successful migration)
- ✅ Removed SQLite dependencies

### 7. Configuration

## 🚀 Next Steps: Deploy to Netlify

### Quick Deploy Checklist

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not done)
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Converted to MongoDB for Netlify"
   git push
   ```

2. **Go to Netlify**
   - Visit https://app.netlify.com/
   - Click "Add new site" → "Import an existing project"
   - Select your repository

3. **Configure Build**
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `.next`

4. **⚠️ CRITICAL: Add Environment Variable**
   - Go to **Site settings** → **Environment variables**
   - Add: `MONGODB_URI` = `mongodb+srv://satwik:<password>@cluster0.uduh1te.mongodb.net/budget_tracker?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0`
   
5. **Deploy!**
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)
   - Test your deployed site

📖 **Full deployment instructions**: See `NETLIFY_DEPLOYMENT.md`

---

## 🧪 Testing Locally

Your local environment is ready:

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Open browser
http://localhost:3000
```

All data is now in MongoDB - test that everything works!

## 🔒 Security Recommendations

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Update MongoDB Password

Your current connection string uses a simple password (`1234`). For production:

1. Go to **MongoDB Atlas** → **Database Access**
2. Update user `satwik` with a strong password
3. Update `MONGODB_URI` in:
   - `.env.local` (local development)
   - Netlify environment variables (production)

Example strong connection string:
```
mongodb+srv://satwik:Y0urStr0ng!P@ssw0rd@cluster0.uduh1te.mongodb.net/budget_tracker?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Cluster0
```

### Other Security Tips

- ✅ `.env.local` is already gitignored (safe)
- ✅ Never commit MongoDB passwords to Git
- ✅ Consider separate dev/prod databases
- ✅ Enable MongoDB Atlas IP whitelist (optional)

---

## 📊 MongoDB Atlas Setup

Your current configuration:

- **Cluster**: cluster0.uduh1te.mongodb.net
- **Database**: budget_tracker
- **Plan**: Free tier (M0)
- **Collections**: 4 (expenses, settings, fixedExpenses, fixedExpenseOverrides)

### Free Tier Limits
- Storage: 512 MB
- RAM: Shared
- Good for personal use

### Monitor Usage
Check MongoDB Atlas dashboard for:
- Storage usage
- Connection count
- Query performance

---

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### App won't connect to MongoDB locally
```bash
# Check .env.local exists
ls .env.local

# Verify MongoDB URI is correct
cat .env.local
```

### Netlify deployment fails
- Ensure `MONGODB_URI` is set in Netlify environment variables
- Check build logs for specific errors
- Verify MongoDB Atlas allows connections from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)

### Data missing after deployment
- MongoDB Atlas might have IP whitelist enabled
- Go to **Network Access** and allow all IPs: `0.0.0.0/0`

---

## 📈 Performance Notes

- **Cold starts**: First request might be slower (MongoDB connection)
- **Caching**: API responses are cached (10-60 seconds)
- **Indexes**: Added for optimal query performance
- **Connection pooling**: Mongoose handles automatically

---

## 📝 Important Notes

### Migration Script
- The migration script (`npm run migrate`) should only be run **once**
- Running it again will duplicate your data
- It's safe to delete the script after successful deployment

### Old SQLite Files
- `budget.db` has been **deleted** (data is now in MongoDB)
- `src/lib/db.ts` has been **deleted** (using MongoDB now)
- If you need the old data, restore from Git history

### Environment Variables
- **Local**: `.env.local` (gitignored)
- **Production**: Set in Netlify dashboard
- Same MongoDB database for both (can separate if needed)
