# Savings Goals Feature - Implementation Summary

## Overview
A comprehensive savings goal tracking module has been implemented on the yearly page, allowing users to set financial goals, track progress, and manage contributions with full history.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Goal Creation & Management
- **Create Goals**: Users can create savings goals with:
  - Goal name (e.g., "Vacation to Goa", "Emergency Fund")
  - Target amount (in ₹)
  - Deadline date
  - Optional monthly savings target (informational only)
  
- **Edit Goals**: Modify goal details at any time
- **Archive Goals**: Move completed or inactive goals to archived section
- **Delete Goals**: Permanently remove goals with confirmation

### 2. Contribution Tracking
- **Manual Contributions**: Users can manually add savings amounts
  - Enter amount saved
  - Specify date of contribution
  - Add optional notes (e.g., "Monthly savings", "Bonus")
  
- **Contribution History**: Complete timestamped history of all contributions
  - View all contributions for a goal
  - Sorted by date (newest first)
  - Shows total contributed amount

### 3. Visual Progress Tracking
- **Progress Bars**: Dynamic color-coded progress bars
  - Green: Completed goals (100%+)
  - Blue: On track (30+ days remaining)
  - Yellow: Warning (less than 30 days remaining)
  - Red: Overdue goals
  
- **Countdown Timer**: Days remaining until deadline
  - Shows "X days remaining" for active goals
  - Shows "Overdue by X days" for past deadlines
  
- **Progress Percentage**: Real-time percentage calculation
- **Amount Display**: Current vs Target (e.g., "₹25,000 of ₹50,000")

### 4. Status Management
- **Active Goals**: Currently being pursued
- **Completed Goals**: Automatically marked when target is reached
- **Archived Goals**: Manually archived by user, viewable separately

### 5. UI/UX Features
- **Responsive Grid Layout**: 1-3 columns based on screen size
- **Loading States**: Animated loading indicator
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no goals exist
- **Confirmation Dialogs**: Prevent accidental deletions
- **Form Validation**: Ensures data integrity
