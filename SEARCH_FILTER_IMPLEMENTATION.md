# Search & Filter Implementation - Summary

## Overview
Successfully implemented comprehensive search and advanced filtering functionality for the budget tracking application. Users can now search expenses by name and filter by date range and amount range on both Yearly and Monthly pages.

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Database Schema
- **FilterPreset Model** (`src/lib/models/FilterPreset.ts`)
  - Stores user filter configurations in MongoDB
  - Fields: name, userId, filters (searchQuery, dateRange, amountRange), year
  - Indexed on userId and year for optimal performance

### 2. API Routes
- **GET /api/filter-presets** - Fetch all filter presets for current user and year
- **POST /api/filter-presets** - Create new filter preset
- **DELETE /api/filter-presets/[id]** - Delete a filter preset
- All routes are protected with Clerk authentication

### 3. UI Components

#### SearchAndFilterPanel Component
Location: `src/components/SearchAndFilterPanel.tsx`

Features:
- **Real-time search input** (debounced 300ms for performance)
- **Date range picker** with start/end date inputs
- **Amount range slider** with min/max values
- **Filter presets management**:
  - Save current filter configuration
  - Load saved presets with one click
  - Delete unwanted presets
- **Clear all filters** button
- **Visual indicator** when filters are active

#### SearchResultsDisplay Component
Location: `src/components/SearchResultsDisplay.tsx`

Features:
- Displays filtered expenses in a clean table format
- Shows expense name, month (with colored badge), date, and amount
- Total calculation at the bottom
- Empty state message when no results found
- Responsive design

### 4. Page Integration

#### Yearly Page (`src/app/page.tsx`)
- Search panel added above expense list
- Filters work across both yearly and monthly expenses
- When filters are active, shows SearchResultsDisplay with month badges
- When no filters active, shows original ExpenseList component
- Filters reset automatically when year changes
- Dynamic max amount calculation for slider

#### Monthly Page (`src/app/monthly/page.tsx`)
- Search panel added at the top of expenses section
- Searches across ALL months in the selected year
- Works in both "current month" and "all months" view modes
- Filtered results displayed prominently when search is active
- Filters reset automatically when year changes
- Shows month information for each expense in results

## How It Works

### Filter Logic
All filters are combined with AND logic:

1. **Search Query**: Case-insensitive partial match on expense name
2. **Date Range**: Filters by expense.date within selected range
3. **Amount Range**: Filters expenses between min and max amounts

### Filter Presets
- Users can save their current filter configuration with a custom name
- Presets are stored in MongoDB per user and year
- Click any preset to instantly apply those filters
- Delete button available for each preset

### User Experience Features
- **Debounced search**: 300ms delay for real-time search without performance issues
- **Visual indicators**: "Active" badge shows when filters are applied
- **Automatic reset**: Filters clear when switching years
- **No results handling**: Friendly message when search yields no results
- **Preserved sorting**: Existing sort functionality works with filters
- **Responsive design**: Works well on mobile and desktop

## Technical Details

### State Management
- Filter state managed locally in each page component
- Resets when navigating between pages (as per requirements)
- Memoized filtering for performance optimization

### Performance Optimizations
- useMemo hooks for filtered and sorted expense lists
- Debounced search input (300ms)
- Efficient MongoDB indexes on FilterPreset model
- Dynamic max amount calculation only when expenses change

### Error Handling
- API routes protected with authentication
- Graceful handling of missing data
- Console error logging for debugging
- User-friendly error messages

## Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `src/lib/models/FilterPreset.ts` - Database model
- `src/app/api/filter-presets/route.ts` - GET and POST endpoints
- `src/app/api/filter-presets/[id]/route.ts` - DELETE endpoint
- `src/components/SearchAndFilterPanel.tsx` - Main filter UI component
- `src/components/SearchResultsDisplay.tsx` - Results display component

### Modified Files
- `src/app/page.tsx` - Integrated search/filter into Yearly page
- `src/app/monthly/page.tsx` - Integrated search/filter into Monthly page

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Search Functionality**
   - Test partial name matching
   - Test case-insensitivity
   - Test with special characters

2. **Date Range Filter**
   - Test with only start date
   - Test with only end date
   - Test with both dates
   - Test with dates spanning multiple months

3. **Amount Range Filter**
   - Test min only
   - Test max only
   - Test both min and max
   - Test edge cases (0, very large amounts)

4. **Filter Presets**
   - Save preset with all filters
   - Save preset with partial filters
   - Load preset and verify all filters apply
   - Delete preset
   - Test across different years

5. **Integration**
   - Test filter reset when changing years
   - Test on both Yearly and Monthly pages
   - Test in both Monthly view modes
   - Test with no expenses
   - Test with large dataset

## Future Enhancement Ideas

1. Add category/tag fields to Expense model for more filtering options
2. Export filtered results to CSV/Excel
3. Advanced filters: OR logic, exclude patterns
4. Search history suggestions
5. Keyboard shortcuts for quick filtering
6. Filter analytics (most used filters, etc.)
7. Bulk operations on filtered results
8. Share filter presets between users in same team

## Notes

- Filters are intentionally reset when navigating between pages (per user requirement)
- Real-time search provides immediate feedback without clicking search button
- Amount slider uses step of â‚¹100 for smooth interaction
- MongoDB's _id field is used for preset IDs (converted from ObjectId)
- All API routes use Clerk authentication for security
