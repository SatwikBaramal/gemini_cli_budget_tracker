- Node.js runtime (required for ExcelJS and Mongoose)
- Proper authentication using NextAuth
- Type-safe implementation with TypeScript interfaces
- Efficient data fetching with Promise.all
- Comprehensive error handling

#### Frontend Components
- **File**: `src/components/ExportDataDialog.tsx`
  - Year selection with checkboxes

  - Error handling with user-friendly messages
  - Automatic file download with descriptive filenames

- **File**: `src/components/Header.tsx` (modified)
  - Added Export Data button with download icon

  - Clean UI matching existing design

#### Library Added
- **ExcelJS v4.4.0**: Industry-standard library for Excel file generation
  - Supports multiple sheets
  - Advanced formatting capabilities
  - XLSX format (modern Excel)
  - Server-side generation

#### Authentication Fix
- Created separate auth config (`src/lib/auth.config.ts`) for Edge runtime compatibility
- Fixed middleware to work with Next.js 15 Edge runtime
- Resolved mongoose/Edge runtime conflicts

### 5. File Naming Convention
- Single year: `Budget_Data_2025.xlsx`

- ‚úÖ Fixed expenses with applicable months
- ‚úÖ Fixed expense overrides
- ‚úÖ Monthly income with overrides
- ‚úÖ All savings goals (regardless of year)
- ‚úÖ Complete contribution history for goals

## Files Created
1. `src/app/api/export/excel/route.ts` - API endpoint for Excel generation
2. `src/components/ExportDataDialog.tsx` - Year selection dialog component
3. `src/lib/auth.config.ts` - Edge-compatible auth configuration

## Files Modified
1. `src/components/Header.tsx` - Added Export Data button
2. `src/lib/auth.ts` - Updated to use separate auth config
3. `src/middleware.ts` - Fixed for Edge runtime compatibility
4. `src/app/sign-in/[[...sign-in]]/page.tsx` - Fixed TypeScript error
5. `package.json` - Added exceljs dependency

## Industry Standards Followed
- ‚úÖ Clear, descriptive sheet names
- ‚úÖ Consistent tabular structure
- ‚úÖ No merged cells (for data integrity)
- ‚úÖ Unique, descriptive column headers
- ‚úÖ Proper currency formatting
- ‚úÖ Frozen header rows for navigation
- ‚úÖ Color coding for visual clarity
- ‚úÖ Professional borders and alignment
- ‚úÖ Separate sheets for different data categories
- ‚úÖ Summary sheet for quick overview

## Testing Recommendations
1. Test with single year selection
2. Test with multiple years selection
3. Test with years that have no data
4. Test with large datasets
5. Test with goals that have many contributions
6. Test with all goal statuses (active, completed, archived)
7. Verify Excel file opens correctly in Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, and LibreOffice

## Future Enhancement Possibilities
- Add filtering options (date ranges, specific categories)
- Include charts and graphs in Excel
- Add a "Settings" sheet with user preferences
- Support for exporting only specific data types
